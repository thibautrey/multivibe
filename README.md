MultiVibe exposes the same inference routes under `/v1` and at the root for
clients that expect either style. In the shipped Compose profile, the public
`:1455` socket is served directly by the native Rust edge; Node.js remains on
loopback `127.0.0.1:1456` for the dashboard, OAuth, static assets, and
control-plane routes. Compatibility endpoints for Ollama- and LiteLLM-style
discovery are also available.

## ⬇️ Download MultiVibe Host

MultiVibe Host is the fastest way to run the complete, security-bounded local
Host: gateway, dashboard, private device identity, provider agent, and managed
model runtime. Official builds are published together in one verified release.

| Platform | Official package | Requirements | Download |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **macOS** | Signed and notarized `.dmg` for Apple Silicon and Intel | Apple Silicon (`arm64`) or Intel (`amd64`) Mac | **[Download the latest macOS release →](https://github.com/thibautrey/multivibe/releases/latest)** |
| **Linux** | Signed native Host archive | Linux `x86_64` with an NVIDIA GPU, compute capability 7.0+ | **[Download the latest Linux release →](https://github.com/thibautrey/multivibe/releases/latest)** |
| **Windows** | Verified native `.zip` for amd64 | Windows amd64 with an NVIDIA GPU, compute capability 7.0+ | **[Download the latest Windows release →](https://github.com/thibautrey/multivibe/releases/latest)** |
| **Docker / Unraid** | Hardened image on GitHub Container Registry | Linux `x86_64`, Docker or Unraid, NVIDIA container runtime | **[Open the latest Docker release →](https://github.com/thibautrey/multivibe/releases/latest)** |

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS installation</strong></summary>

### macOS

Open the latest release and choose the disk image for your Mac:

- `darwin_arm64.dmg` for Apple Silicon (M1 or newer)
- `darwin_amd64.dmg` for Intel

Open the DMG, drag **MultiVibe Host** to **Applications**, then launch it. The
app is signed with Developer ID, notarized by Apple, and runs from the menu bar.
Its menu-bar label shows aggregate remaining OpenAI weekly and five-hour
capacity when available. Opening it presents a native account overview with
per-account quota windows, reset times, and health without exposing account
tokens to the interface process.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Linux installation</strong></summary>

### Linux

Download the Linux `amd64` release assets and follow `NATIVE-MULTIPART.txt` when
the archive is split into several parts. After reconstructing and extracting
the archive, run:

```sh
./install.sh
```

The installer verifies the release and supported NVIDIA hardware before it
starts the Host. It installs for the current user and does not require root.
On systems with a user systemd manager it also enables the signed automatic
update timer. The timer checks hourly but the updater itself schedules one
network check every 10 to 14 hours with a local random offset.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows installation</strong></summary>

### Windows

Download the `windows_amd64.zip` release, extract it to a temporary directory,
then run PowerShell as the current user:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
```

The installer verifies the complete bundle and the local NVIDIA driver before
it changes the machine. It requires Windows amd64 and a GPU with compute
capability 7.0 or newer, installs without administrator privileges, and
registers a per-user Start Menu shortcut, login entry, `multivibe://` protocol
handler, and scheduled update task. The native Win32 tray menu starts and
stops the Host and opens the local dashboard. Application files are kept under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\MultiVibe Host`; private state and logs remain under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\MultiVibe`.

PowerShell 5.1 or newer is required. The Windows updater verifies the signed
feed and ZIP contents, stops only MultiVibe processes whose executable paths
belong to the managed installation, and restores the previous version if the
new Host does not pass its health check.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Docker and Unraid installation</strong></summary>

### Docker and Unraid

The current Host release workflow publishes the same verified Linux bundle to
GHCR as both an immutable version and the rolling `latest` tag:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/thibautrey/multivibe-host:latest
```

For reproducible deployments, use the versioned tag or immutable digest shown
in the matching [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/thibautrey/multivibe/releases/latest).
Docker Compose and Unraid setup are documented in
[Provider Host container](#provider-host-container-docker-compose-and-unraid).

</details>

### Updates and release verification

Native macOS, Linux, and Windows installations check an authenticated release feed and,
by default, download and install an eligible stable release while the Host is
idle. The updater drains new work, waits for active requests and model
operations, verifies the archive with an embedded Ed25519 trust root, stages
the replacement, and restores the previous version if the restarted Host does
not pass its health check. The dashboard and macOS menu bar can switch between
automatic installation, automatic download, and notification-only modes.

Containers never receive the Docker socket and never replace themselves. For
generic Docker Compose, install the host-side updater from the verified Linux
archive. Unraid users may use the platform's automatic application update
mechanism with the published `latest` tag.

> [!NOTE]
> If GHCR reports that the package is not found, no tagged Host release with
> Docker publishing has completed yet. Use an official native release or build
> from this repository instead of installing an unverified third-party image.

> [!TIP]
> Native archives include signed checksums, SBOMs, and GitHub build-provenance
> attestations. See the [verification and installation guide](./packaging/PROVIDER-HOST-README.md)
> before deploying a Host on shared or production infrastructure.

## 🚀 Quick start

### Requirements

- Docker with Compose v2
- Git, curl, and Node.js 22+ on the deployment host
- At least one supported provider account or API key

### 1. Clone and secure the deployment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thibautrey/multivibe.git
cd multivibe
```

> [!WARNING]
> MultiVibe controls upstream accounts that may carry paid quotas. The shipped
> Compose file uses `ADMIN_TOKEN=change-me` as a local placeholder, and the
> inference API is unrestricted when no proxy API key exists. Replace the admin
> token, configure `PROXY_API_KEY` (or create application keys immediately),
> and keep port 1455 behind a private network or authenticated TLS proxy before
> exposing it outside a trusted host.

Store both initial secrets in the ignored `.env` file:

```dotenv
ADMIN_TOKEN=<long-random-admin-secret>
PROXY_API_KEY=<long-random-proxy-secret>
```

The existing proxy-key entry already reads `.env`. Replace the literal admin
entry in `docker-compose.yml` with required interpolation so Compose cannot
start without the secret:

```yaml
- ADMIN_TOKEN=${ADMIN_TOKEN:?ADMIN_TOKEN must be set in .env}
```

Do not commit either value. For a managed deployment, use its secret-injection
mechanism instead of `.env`.

### 2. Build and deploy

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

The deployment script records the current commit identity in `.env`, rebuilds
and recreates the container, then waits for `/health` to report the same
`gitSha` and `buildId`. Use `HEALTH_URL` for a remote deployment:

```bash
HEALTH_URL=https://multivibe.example/health ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

After startup:

- Dashboard: [http://localhost:1455](http://localhost:1455)
- Health: [http://localhost:1455/health](http://localhost:1455/health)

```bash
curl -fsS http://localhost:1455/health
```

`/health` is a liveness and build-identity check only; it does not validate
storage or provider access. The authenticated `/v1/models` request in step 4 is
the first end-to-end smoke test.

### 3. Add a provider

Open **Accounts** in the dashboard and add at least one account. OAuth and
manual-key options differ by provider; see
[Providers and onboarding](#-providers-and-onboarding).

### 4. Call the API

```bash
export MULTIVIBE_API_KEY="replace-with-your-proxy-key"

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MULTIVIBE_API_KEY" \
  http://localhost:1455/v1/models
```

Point an OpenAI-compatible client at `http://localhost:1455/v1` and use the
same key. The requested model can be a discovered provider model or an enabled
MultiVibe alias.

### Routine operations

```bash
# Container state and recent logs
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f --tail=200 multivibe

# Clean stop and start
docker compose stop multivibe
docker compose start multivibe

# Update to the latest fast-forward commit and rebuild
git pull --ff-only
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

`docker compose restart` only restarts the existing image; it does not rebuild
new code. To roll back from a clean deployment checkout, switch to a known-good
commit, run `./scripts/deploy.sh`, and switch back to your normal branch before
the next update.

## 🔌 Providers and onboarding

| Provider | Authentication | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI / ChatGPT | Browser callback or device OAuth | Uses ChatGPT/Codex account tokens, automatic refresh, model discovery, and quota-aware rotation |
| OpenAI-compatible | Base URL plus API key | Works with hosted or local compatible servers; location can be inferred or set to `local`/`cloud` |
| OpenCode Zen / Go | Console API key or official device OAuth | Discovers the account API root; Go usage can expose rolling 5-hour, weekly, and monthly windows |
| Mistral | API key | Manual account entry with Responses or compatibility bridging |
| z.ai | Coding Plan API key | Uses the Coding Plan chat-completions endpoint and exposes discovered z.ai models |
| Grok Build | xAI device OAuth or official CLI `auth.json` import | Uses the subscription contract and CLI headers rather than pay-per-token `XAI_API_KEY` billing |

### OpenAI

For browser OAuth, MultiVibe opens the authorization page and asks you to paste
the full callback URL after login. Device OAuth is usually simpler on a remote
or headless host: approve the one-time code and the dashboard completes the
flow automatically.

The bundled OpenAI client ID is registered for this browser callback:

```text
http://localhost:1455/auth/callback
```

Keep this localhost callback for the copy-and-paste flow even when MultiVibe is
remote, or use device OAuth. A different `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` also requires an
`OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` whose provider registration includes that exact URI.

### OpenCode

Choose **OpenCode Zen / Go** to enter an API key, or use **Connect OpenCode
account** for the official `opencode-cli` device flow. OpenCode Go API keys expose
5-hour, weekly, and monthly usage through `/zen/go/v1/usage`. Monthly resets
follow the subscription period, so MultiVibe uses the provider's reset timestamp.

Console device connections using `/inference/openai` do not expose this Go usage
endpoint. MultiVibe shows `N/A` with an explanation for those connections; connect
a Go API key separately to monitor Go quotas. An explicit missing Go subscription
also shows `N/A`. Authentication, workspace, endpoint, and malformed-response
errors stay visible as failed quota refreshes without disabling inference.

Console credentials and workspace headers are resolved for each request, including
after token refresh. Reauthentication preserves the previously selected workspace.
See [OpenCode integration notes](docs/opencode-integration.md) for the verified
contracts and validation limits.

### Grok Build

Grok Build device OAuth is the preferred option. Existing official CLI
credentials can be imported from `XAI_AUTH_PATH`; `xai::api_key` and deprecated
pre-OIDC `web_login` entries are ignored. If the CLI and MultiVibe run
concurrently, prefer separate device authorization because refresh tokens
rotate.

To import a host file into Docker, mount it read-only:

```yaml
services:
  multivibe:
    environment:
      - XAI_AUTH_PATH=/run/secrets/grok-auth.json
    volumes:
      - /absolute/path/to/.grok/auth.json:/run/secrets/grok-auth.json:ro
```

Grok Build subscription access is intended for the account owner or another
trusted operator. Review current provider terms before offering it to other
users.

---

## 🔗 API surface

### Authentication

| Surface | Authentication |
| --- | --- |
| Dashboard and `/admin/*` | `ADMIN_TOKEN` through the login session, `x-admin-token`, or Bearer token |
| Inference, jobs, capacity, Realtime, and WebSocket | `PROXY_API_KEY` or an entry from `PROXY_API_KEYS`/the dashboard; Bearer and `x-api-key` are accepted |
| Codex project registration | `CODEX_PROJECT_REGISTRATION_TOKEN` through `x-codex-project-token` |
| `/health` and static dashboard assets | Unauthenticated |

When no proxy key is configured, inference routes are open. Each application
key records its application name in traces and isolates its deferred jobs.
Applications still share the provider account pool and quota state; deferred
scheduling fairness and result webhooks are configured per application.

`/v1` is not reverse-proxied through Express in the native profile. Rust reads
the shared account store, performs authentication, routing, protocol
conversion, streaming, and upstream selection itself. Requests outside `/v1`
are forwarded by the edge to the loopback Node control plane.

### Public endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/v1/models`, `/v1/models/:id` | Discovered models and enabled aliases |
| `POST` | `/v1/responses` | OpenAI Responses; JSON, SSE, or WebSocket |
| `POST` | `/v1/responses/compact` | Responses compaction |
| `POST` | `/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI Chat Completions; JSON or SSE |
| `POST` | `/v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages compatibility; JSON or SSE |
| `POST` | `/v1/realtime/calls` | Realtime WebRTC SDP negotiation |
| `GET` | `/v1/realtime/voices`, `/v1/settings/voices` | ChatGPT voice eligibility and catalog |
| `GET` | `/v1/capacity`, `/v1/capacity/events` | Application-visible capacity snapshot and resumable SSE |
| `GET`/`DELETE` | `/v1/jobs/*` | Deferred job state, events, results, and cancellation |

Inference and model routes are also exposed without `/v1`. Discovery
compatibility routes include `/api/v1/models`, `/api/tags`, `/version`,
`/props`, and `/v1/props`.

The model IDs in the examples are illustrative. Replace them with a model or
enabled alias returned by your own `GET /v1/models` response.

### Responses example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:1455/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MULTIVIBE_API_KEY" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5.3-codex",
    "input": "Explain quota-aware routing in one sentence."
  }'
```

Set `"stream": true` and use `curl -N` for SSE.

### Chat Completions example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:1455/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MULTIVIBE_API_KEY" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5.3-codex",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
  }'
```

### Anthropic Messages example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:1455/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: $MULTIVIBE_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5.3-codex",
    "max_tokens": 512,
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
  }'
```

MultiVibe maps Anthropic text, images, tools, tool results, usage, errors, and
stream events to the selected upstream dialect.

### Responses over WebSocket

Connect to `ws://localhost:1455/v1/responses`, authenticate during the upgrade,
and send Codex-style `response.create` frames:

```js
import WebSocket from "ws";

const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:1455/v1/responses", {
  headers: { Authorization: "Bearer " + process.env.MULTIVIBE_API_KEY },
});

ws.on("open", () => {
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: "response.create",
    model: "gpt-5.3-codex",
    input: [{ role: "user", content: [{ type: "input_text", text: "Hello" }] }],
    stream: true,
  }));
});
```

WebSocket transport is available for `/responses` only.
This is a Node.js example using the installed `ws` package; browser WebSocket
clients cannot attach the required authorization header during the handshake.

### Realtime voice

MultiVibe proxies the native multipart SDP handshake; audio then flows directly
over the negotiated WebRTC connection. By default it selects an eligible
OpenAI/ChatGPT account:

```dotenv
REALTIME_PROVIDER=openai
```

To use a billed OpenAI-compatible Realtime API account, opt in explicitly:

```dotenv
REALTIME_PROVIDER=openai-compatible
REALTIME_WEBRTC_CALL_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/calls
```

This mode is never selected silently as a fallback from a ChatGPT subscription.

---

## 🧠 Routing strategy

### Direct provider models

For a discovered model, MultiVibe:

1. Builds the enabled account/provider candidate pool.
2. Excludes active account/model blocks and unsupported model mappings.
3. Avoids a five-hour window near its configured threshold while another
   eligible candidate remains.
4. Normally prefers the lowest known weekly usage; equal quota tiers alternate
   across requests.
5. Only when every effective candidate is near its five-hour limit, prefers the
   greatest known remaining five-hour headroom.
6. Uses weekly reset timing and configured priority as secondary ordering signals.
7. Rotates on quota-like failures and retries bounded transient upstream errors.

Optional `CODEX_SESSION_AFFINITY` keeps a session on the same eligible account
per application and provider. Affinity never bypasses quota or policy filters.

### Smart aliases

Aliases are schema-v2 policies. The first matching rule can inspect:

- application and priority;
- reasoning effort and input size;
- text/image/audio/video modalities;
- tool requirements and execution mode;
- day/time windows.

Constraints filter candidates by local/cloud location, predicted wait, context
window, and quality. Remaining candidates are scored for latency, cost,
quality, and locality. Capacity comes from configured profiles, requests in
flight, quota blocks, health/metrics probes, and learned throughput.

Rules can continue to the next rule, queue work, or reject when no destination
has capacity. Optional cloud budgets emit application-scoped warnings.

The dashboard includes guided redirect, ordered fallback, and local-to-cloud
presets, plus an advanced editor and a no-inference policy simulator. Legacy
`targets` payloads are migrated to schema v2 when accepted.

### Image routing

`imageRequestModelOverride` can redirect image-bearing requests to a currently
exposed model or enabled alias. MultiVibe preserves image parts while bridging
Chat Completions `image_url` and Responses `input_image` payloads.

### Admission and deferred jobs

Inference routes accept these optional headers:

| Header | Values / meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `X-MultiVibe-Priority` | `critical`, `interactive`, `standard`, or `batch` |
| `X-MultiVibe-Execution` | `sync`, `auto`, or `defer` |
| `X-MultiVibe-Max-Wait-Ms` | Maximum admission wait |
| `X-MultiVibe-Deadline` | RFC 3339 completion deadline with timezone, for example `2026-09-01T18:00:00Z` |
| `X-MultiVibe-Idempotency-Key` | Stable application idempotency key |
| `X-MultiVibe-Webhook` | Registered application webhook ID |

Without opt-in headers, requests retain synchronous behavior unless the selected
alias defines defaults. Streaming, WebSocket, and Realtime requests cannot be
deferred. A deferred request returns `202 Accepted` and a `multivibe.job`.

For an authenticated, synchronous JSON inference, the same idempotency header
also enables a short in-memory single-flight and replay window. The key is
isolated by application and inference route. Reusing it with a different JSON
payload returns `409`; concurrent duplicates share one execution. Responses
include `X-MultiVibe-Idempotency-Status` with `created`, `coalesced`, `replayed`,
or `bypass`.

Direct inference replay is intentionally limited to text-only, non-streaming,
stateless requests without tools. Streaming, tool, multimodal, stored,
background, and conversation-linked requests bypass this layer. Errors,
partial results, tool-call responses, and responses over the configured byte
limit are shared only with already waiting followers and are not retained.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:1455/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MULTIVIBE_API_KEY" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "X-MultiVibe-Priority: batch" \
  -H "X-MultiVibe-Execution: defer" \
  -H "X-MultiVibe-Idempotency-Key: nightly-translation-42" \
  -d '{"model": "gpt-5.3-codex", "input": "..."}'
```

Job endpoints are application-isolated:

- `GET /v1/jobs` and `GET /v1/jobs/:id`
- `GET /v1/jobs/:id/result`
- `GET /v1/jobs/:id/events` with `Last-Event-ID` replay
- `DELETE /v1/jobs/:id`

Inference responses may include `X-MultiVibe-Decision`,
`X-MultiVibe-Priority`, `X-MultiVibe-Resolved-Model`, and
`X-MultiVibe-Idempotency-Status`. Deferred submissions also return a
`Location` header.

For retention, retries, event types, HMAC signatures, polling, and
application-side idempotency, read the
[deferred batch integration guide](./docs/batch-jobs.md). The repository also
contains a reusable [implementation prompt](./docs/prompts/implement-multivibe-batch.md).

---

## 📈 Tracing and project attribution

Recent traces and lightweight historical aggregates are stored separately.
The dashboard and admin API expose request volume, tokens, cache usage,
estimated cost, latency, time to first token, inference speed, provider/model
selection, payload diagnostics, and time-range filtering.
Client request totals and error rates use the final response returned to the
caller, while provider attempts and recovered retries remain visible as routing
telemetry. High-volume control-plane routes such as admin polling, health, and
model discovery are not persisted as inference traces.

Useful admin endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /admin/traces?page=1&pageSize=100` | Paginated recent traces |
| `GET /admin/traces/:id` | Full retained trace |
| `GET /admin/traces/export.zip` | Filtered ZIP export |
| `GET /admin/stats/usage` | Usage by account, route, application, model, and project |
| `GET /admin/stats/traces` | Historical trace statistics |

`sinceMs` and `untilMs` are accepted by stats and export routes. Export also
supports `accountId`, `route`, and `projectId`.

For a source-based explanation of prompt handling, deferred-job retention, telemetry, and the limits of transport encryption, read the [prompt privacy guide](./docs/prompt-privacy.md).

Request bodies and headers are disabled in traces by default. When
`TRACE_INCLUDE_HEADERS=true`, names are retained but credentials, cookies,
tokens, session values, and similar secrets are redacted. Header values are not
copied into long-term history.

### Codex project attribution

The dashboard can generate an installer command for a user-level Codex
`SessionStart` hook. Install it once on every execution host, then review and
trust the hook with `/hooks` inside Codex.

Manual installation from this checkout:

```bash
read -s MULTIVIBE_PROJECT_TOKEN
export MULTIVIBE_PROJECT_TOKEN
node scripts/install-codex-project-hook.mjs --url https://multivibe.example
unset MULTIVIBE_PROJECT_TOKEN
```

The installer preserves existing `~/.codex/hooks.json` entries and stores its
secret with mode `0600`. Exact session mapping wins; deterministic
`X-MultiVibe-Project-Root` plus `X-MultiVibe-Project-Host` headers provide an
unambiguous fallback. `X-LiteLLM-Key-Alias` takes precedence when present.

Set a dedicated `CODEX_PROJECT_REGISTRATION_TOKEN` when possible. If it is
unset, `ADMIN_TOKEN` is used for compatibility; if both are empty, registration
is disabled.

Codex does not run a newly installed or changed user hook until its exact
definition has been reviewed and trusted. On the same local or remote execution
host, open Codex, run `/hooks`, select `SessionStart`, review the MultiVibe
command, and press `t` to trust it. Then start or resume a session. The hook
overview must show the `SessionStart` hook as active rather than awaiting
review.

The hook is synchronous and fail-open. New, resumed, cleared, and compacted
sessions are registered. See the [official Codex hooks documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/hooks/).

Project endpoints:

- `POST /admin/codex-sessions` with `x-codex-project-token`
- `GET /admin/codex-sessions` with `x-admin-token`
- `GET /admin/codex-projects` with `x-admin-token`

## 💾 Persistence

Mount `/data` to preserve state:

| Default path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `/data/accounts.json` | Accounts, aliases, dashboard API keys, application policies, webhooks, and settings |
| `/data/oauth-state.json` | In-progress OAuth state |
| `/data/requests-trace.jsonl` | Recent retained traces |
| `/data/requests-stats-history.jsonl` | Lightweight long-term usage history |
| `/data/anonymous-usage-state.json` | Mode-`0600` anonymous daily retry envelope without a stable installation ID |
| `/data/provider-agent-selection.json` | Mode-`0600` explicit local provider model selection |
| `/data/provider-agent-runtime-endpoints.json` | Mode-`0600` loopback endpoints and optional runtime bearers |
| `/data/provider-agent-device-identity.json` | Mode-`0600` Ed25519 device identity and relay-shadow sequence |
| `/data/provider-agent-cloud-enrollment.json` | Mode-`0600` submitted Cloud shadow node view; never the enrollment grant |
| `/data/codex-projects.json` | Codex session/project registry |
| `/data/v1-edge-jobs.json` | Native Rust jobs, results, retries, and webhook delivery state |
| `/data/jobs.sqlite` | Legacy/control-plane jobs and pre-Rust migration source |

The Compose deployment mounts `./data:/data`. Recent trace retention defaults
to 1,000 entries. Persistent state is not encrypted at rest: `accounts.json`
can contain provider access/refresh tokens, proxy keys, and webhook secrets;
`oauth-state.json` can contain temporary OAuth verifiers; traces and the native
job file or legacy database can contain request and response payloads. Files created by MultiVibe
use restrictive permissions, but the volume and its backups should still be
encrypted, access-controlled, and excluded from public shares.

Job content delivered by webhook or consumed by a client receives a one-hour
grace period; unretrieved content is purged after 30 days. For a consistent
backup, stop the service cleanly, copy the entire `data/` directory (including
`v1-edge-jobs.json`, the `*.pre-rust-backup.sqlite` migration copy, and any
SQLite `-wal` or `-shm` files), then start it again. Restore the complete
directory only while the service is stopped.
### Embedded provider-agent preview

Set `PROVIDER_AGENT_ENABLED=true` to let Core supervise the packaged provider
agent. `PROVIDER_AGENT_BINARY` selects its absolute binary path and
`PROVIDER_AGENT_STATE_PATH` selects the clean absolute local selection file;
by default the file is placed beside `STORE_PATH` as
`provider-agent-selection.json`. `PROVIDER_AGENT_RUNTIME_STATE_PATH` selects
the separate protected manual-runtime file and defaults to
`provider-agent-runtime-endpoints.json` beside `STORE_PATH`. The admin APIs
can inventory the reviewed loopback candidates, configure one literal
loopback endpoint per manual adapter, and persist an explicit model selection
locally. Runtime bearers are accepted only through the local authenticated
admin path, never returned by either API, and retained when an update omits the
secret field.

`PROVIDER_AGENT_DEVICE_KEY_PATH` selects the separate mode-`0600` Ed25519
device identity. The agent exposes only its public key and key ID in the local
manifest. Its authenticated relay-shadow endpoint signs Cloud-compatible
30-second session-open envelopes with a persisted monotonic sequence and fixed
non-commercial locks. This endpoint cannot carry customer content, open a
socket to a relay, enable routing, or create compensation eligibility.
`PROVIDER_AGENT_ENROLLMENT_STATE_PATH` selects the separate submitted-node
state. The authenticated Cloud-shadow enrollment route sends only the exact
selected-model consent manifest to `PROVIDER_AGENT_CLOUD_API_URL`, which is
restricted to `https://auth.multivibe.cloud` (or literal loopback HTTP in
tests), signs the returned challenge, persists no grant or proof, freezes the
submitted selection, and keeps routing and compensation false.

The autonomous host archive also pins `PROVIDER_AGENT_MANAGED_ROOT`,
`PROVIDER_AGENT_BUNDLED_OLLAMA_ROOT`,
`PROVIDER_AGENT_DEPENDENCY_MANIFEST_PATH`,
`PROVIDER_AGENT_MANAGED_PLANNER_STATE_PATH` and
`PROVIDER_AGENT_MODEL_CATALOG_PATH` to its private data directory and signed
bundle layout. Managed demand reconciliation is enabled only when an operator
also supplies `MULTIVIBE_PROVIDER_DEMAND_TRUSTED_KEYS` to the host launcher.
That value is an explicit Ed25519 public-key trust root; the repository's RFC
interop test key is never used as a packaged Cloud key. Without a configured
production trust root, Core still starts but signed demand and managed Ollama
remain unavailable.

The local-account **Share models · Preview** experience exposes the same
inventory and revisioned selection without requiring a separate agent UI.
It does not submit automatically: enrollment requires an explicit one-time
grant and exact manifest. Submission does not advertise capacity, accept
community workloads, or enable earnings and payouts.

If the marketplace is later activated after every production gate passes, the
announced commercial split for eligible, cleared community-workload revenue is
85% to the host operator and a 15% MultiVibe service fee. Applicable taxes,
reserves, disputes and reversals are handled after that split and may reduce or
delay the amount payable. The separate 5% fee applies only to customer
purchases or top-ups; it is not an additional deduction from the host
operator's 85% share. This repository currently implements no payable,
settlement or compensation activation.

The multiarchitecture Core container build compiles the Go agent for the same
target OS and architecture as the final image, runs its complete Go test suite
on the build platform, and installs the static executable at the default
`/opt/multivibe/bin/multivibe-provider-agent` path with no separate download.
The binary remains inert unless `PROVIDER_AGENT_ENABLED=true`; enabling it does
not bypass any of the shadow-only routing or compensation locks above.

### Provider Host container (Docker Compose and Unraid)

The ordinary `docker-compose.yml` runs Core as a gateway. The separate
`packaging/container/docker-compose.host.yml` runs the complete security-bounded **MultiVibe Host**
bundle for Linux amd64 systems with a supported NVIDIA GPU. Official tagged
Host releases publish the exact verified Linux bundle as
`ghcr.io/thibautrey/multivibe-host:<version>` and update the `latest` tag only
after the image has started and reported the expected Host version.

Set the exact URL used by browsers, then start the Host:

```sh
MULTIVIBE_HOST_PUBLIC_URL=http://192.168.1.20:1455 \
  docker compose -f packaging/container/docker-compose.host.yml up -d
```

Use an HTTPS reverse-proxy origin instead when applicable. Container mode sets
`MULTIVIBE_HOST_BIND=0.0.0.0`, but a non-loopback bind fails closed unless
`MULTIVIBE_HOST_PUBLIC_URL` is an explicit path-free HTTP(S) origin. Core uses
that origin for its OAuth callback. Native Host installs retain the secure
`127.0.0.1` default and need no additional setting.

Only Core port `1455` is published. The provider-agent bearer endpoint and the
managed Ollama listener remain on literal loopback inside the same container.
The image uses a read-only root filesystem, prepares only the two declared
mount roots, then drops to fixed uid/gid `10001:10001` with no capabilities.
Random admin and proxy credentials remain in `/data/host-credentials.json` and
are never Compose or Unraid parameters.

`/data` contains small private application state. `/models` is a separate
large persistent volume; the managed runtime uses `/models/runtime`. When the
operator explicitly creates the local capacity policy, use `/models/weights`
as its model storage path. MultiVibe does not silently create that policy,
enable downloads, enroll the device, accept Cloud work, or activate
compensation.

`packaging/unraid/multivibe-host.xml` and `packaging/unraid/ca_profile.xml` follow the official Unraid
Community Applications v2 layout. The template is deliberately marked beta,
requires the Unraid Nvidia Driver runtime, keeps the app unprivileged, and
mounts application state separately from models. The files are ready for
validation and a later Community Applications submission; their presence in
this source repository does not mean the app has already been accepted or
listed in the Unraid catalog.

Provider-agent admin endpoints:

- `GET /admin/provider-agent/adapters`
- `GET /admin/provider-agent/manifest`
- `GET/PUT /admin/provider-agent/runtime-endpoints`
- `GET /admin/provider-agent/detected-models`
- `GET/PUT /admin/provider-agent/selection`
- `GET /admin/provider-agent/cloud-shadow/enrollment`
- `POST /admin/provider-agent/cloud-shadow/enroll`

- `POST /admin/provider-agent/managed-ollama/start`
- `POST /admin/provider-agent/managed-ollama/stop`
- `POST /admin/provider-agent/managed-ollama/reconcile`

### Anonymous model-demand sharing

Anonymous sharing is enabled by default for new and upgraded installations and
can be changed immediately in the **Tracing** tab. The activation timestamp is
materialized during upgrade, so historical usage from before activation is
never backfilled. Re-enabling creates a new activation timestamp.

For each completed UTC day, Core first downloads the public hosted-inference
allowlist. It then reads the lightweight local trace history and prepares at
most 50 contributions containing only an exact allowlisted canonical model ID
and output-token volume rounded down to thousands, capped at one billion tokens
per model. The envelope also contains the UTC-day window and a random event UUID
used only to retry that day safely.

Before each send, Core obtains a short-lived, single-use Cloud admission ticket
and solves a bounded computational challenge. This limits mass submission without
an installation ID; it does not prove the reported usage. Cloud labels these
volumes self-reported and excludes them from popularity ranking and billing.
Admission requires the corresponding updated Cloud deployment and migration;
failed admission retains the pending envelope for a later retry.

Core never shares prompts, responses, input-token volumes, projects, accounts,
emails, hardware, hostnames, request headers, fine-grained timestamps, or a
stable installation ID. If the allowlist or Cloud API is unavailable, the
cycle fails closed and inference continues normally. Unchecking the control
aborts future sends and deletes any unsent envelope immediately.

---

## 🧩 Plugins

MultiVibe supports versioned lifecycle plugins that can validate, transform,
or answer inference requests at defined request and response hooks. The
dashboard's **Plugins** tab lets an administrator install a public GitHub
repository, inspect its pinned commit and declared hooks, enable or disable it,
fetch an explicit update, and remove a disabled third-party plugin.

The same tab includes a searchable marketplace grouped by manifest categories.
Operators can submit a public repository for validation and inclusion in their
instance catalog, then install any listed plugin with one click. Marketplace
entries are metadata snapshots and are never executed until explicitly
installed and enabled.

Plugins are loaded as fully trusted JavaScript inside the MultiVibe process.
They have the same access to requests, credentials, storage, and the network as
MultiVibe itself, so review the complete repository and every update before
running it. Installs are pinned to a commit and never update automatically.
Code installs and updates require a restart; enable and disable actions apply
to new requests.

The bundled **Security** plugin is enabled by default and provides reversible,
session-scoped pseudonymization before prompt content leaves MultiVibe.

See the **[complete plugins guide](./docs/plugins.md)** for installation and
update workflows, the admin API, persistence and trust boundaries, the v1
manifest format, hook semantics, settings, failure policies, and a complete
plugin example.

## 🛠️ Local development

Use Node.js 22 or later. The repository has separate API and web lockfiles:

```bash
npm ci
npm --prefix web ci
```

Application storage defaults to `/data`, which is normally writable only in
the container. Point all persistent paths at the ignored checkout-local
`data/` directory before running the API directly:

```bash
mkdir -p data
export STORE_PATH="$PWD/data/accounts.json"
export OAUTH_STATE_PATH="$PWD/data/oauth-state.json"
export TRACE_FILE_PATH="$PWD/data/requests-trace.jsonl"
export TRACE_STATS_HISTORY_PATH="$PWD/data/requests-stats-history.jsonl"
export CODEX_PROJECTS_PATH="$PWD/data/codex-projects.json"
export JOBS_DB_PATH="$PWD/data/jobs.sqlite"
```

Set non-placeholder `ADMIN_TOKEN` and `PROXY_API_KEY` values as well if the
development server is reachable beyond your machine. Build the dashboard once
before starting the watched API server:

```bash
npm run build:web
npm run dev
```

Production-style validation:

```bash
npm run build
npm test
npm start
```

To exercise the native edge locally, build the Rust workspace and start the
control-plane pair with the same loopback split used by Compose:

```bash
cargo test -p multivibe-v1-edge
# Terminal 1: Node control plane
MULTIVIBE_CONTROL_PLANE=true \
  V1_EDGE_INTERNAL_JOB_TOKEN="local-development-only" \
  PORT=1456 HOST=127.0.0.1 npm run dev

# Terminal 2: native Rust edge
V1_EDGE_PORT=1455 V1_EDGE_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  NODE_CONTROL_PLANE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1456 \
  V1_EDGE_INTERNAL_JOB_TOKEN="local-development-only" \
  cargo run -p multivibe-v1-edge
```

Available scripts:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Watch the TypeScript API server |
| `npm run build:web` | Type-check and build the React dashboard |
| `npm run build:api` | Compile the API |
| `npm run build:proxy-core-native` | Build the optional Rust/N-API payload inspector |
| `npm run build` | Build dashboard and API |
| `npm test` | Run the Node test suite |
| `npm run test:proxy-core-native` | Build and test the Rust/N-API addon against shared fixtures |
| `npm start` | Run the compiled server with instrumentation |
